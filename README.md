## Key Features ‚ú®

![usecase drawio](https://github.com/ashleshshenoy/vaani/assets/73695378/21964c2f-0926-44e8-8fcf-29a7208015b2)

- **Sign Language Generation and Detection**: Supports both the generation of sign language from text or speech and the detection of sign gestures, ensuring a full conversational loop.
  
- **NLP Module**: An advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) module facilitates the dispatch of relevant video URLs to the frontend. These URLs are fetched from AWS S3, allowing for continuous playback of sign gestures. This seamless integration ensures real-time generation of sign language gestures.

- **Object Detection Model**: Includes an object detection model specifically trained for Indian Sign Language, capable of detecting sign gestures from the client application.

- **Mobile Optimization**: To ensure accessibility across platforms, especially mobile, we utilize the MobileNetV2 model from TensorFlow. This model is optimized for performance on mobile devices, providing a smooth and efficient user experience.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Features an easy-to-use user interface, making it accessible for users of all ages and technical backgrounds. The intuitive design enhances the conversational ability for both hearing and deaf individuals.
